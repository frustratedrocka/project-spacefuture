Hive Cultists

They decide they want in on [[Database/History/The Hive Mind\|The Hive Mind]] even though it has been cut off, which leads down a path of kidnapping, experimentation, and cannibalism. This leads to something like a mixture of the hivemind and Superkuru coming into being; it's all the worst aspects of the concept of a Hivemind the OG avoided. 

Don't like [[Database/Factions/Mindful Eyes\|Mindful Eyes]] - think they could do better if only they were given a chance. If they find a member, *take them*. "Never Turn A Blind Eye" includes being ever-vigilant and never missing an opportunity.
